## ðŸš€ Role Variables

These variables must be defined (you can use Vault to encrypt them):

| Variable            | Description                     | Example |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|---------|
| `ssh_public_key`    | SSH public key for the secure user | `ssh-rsa AAAAB3N...` |

You can store this securely in `group_vars/all/vault.yml` and encrypt it with Ansible Vault.

Example `group_vars/all/vault.yml`:
```yaml
ssh_public_key: YOUR_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY
secure_user: deployer
